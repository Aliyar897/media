"JI, govt on 'same page' about most demands: Attaullah Tarar","SA Information minister says govt has ordered release of 35 JI members arrested during protests Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that the government agrees with the demands presented by the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) delegation and emphasised the government's commitment to working tirelessly for the public's relief. Following a meeting with the JI delegation on Sunday, Tarar noted that the discussions with the delegation had been conducted in a very positive and cordial environment. The delegation presented a list of ten demands, most of which pertain to electricity-related issues. The government's negotiation team included Tarar, Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Maqam, senior PML-N leader Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and Prime Minister's Media Coordinator Badr Shahbaz. The minister confirmed the government's alignment with the delegation's concerns and expressed a strong desire to address public relief needs. He also mentioned that the government has ordered the immediate release of 35 JI members arrested during the protests. Efforts are underway to reduce government expenditures, Tarar added. A technical committee has been formed, including representatives from the Ministry of Water and Power, the Energy Secretary, the FBR, and the Ministry of Finance. He explained that financial flexibility would be achieved through privatisation, the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and economic reforms, which would then be used to provide relief to the public. Read Hafiz Naeem warns govt of intensified protests over ‘fascist tactics The minister noted that if international oil prices decrease, relief would be extended to the people, adding that the government is committed to taking all possible steps to improve current conditions. He further stated that investments from friendly countries are expected to bring positive changes and create job opportunities. Tarar mentioned that efforts are being made to commence the next round of talks on Monday, aiming for a smooth resolution of the issues. Muqam also addressed the media, stating that the technical committee will engage in discussions with JI tomorrow. He underscored the government's commitment to keeping the country running effectively.  Earlier, Ameer of Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, stated that when the ruling class fails to work and the Parliament becomes nothing more than a rubber stamp, the public is forced to take to the streets. Addressing the participants of a protest sit-in at Liaquat Bagh in Rawalpindi, he emphasised that no one desires to leave their homes and sit on the streets. However, they have come out for the future of the country and will stay until their demands are met. ""Agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) were kept hidden, and upon investigation, it was revealed that the ruling class was involved. The budget for capacity charges on electricity surpasses the defence budget. IPPs that are working properly should continue, but those that are not should be completely shut down,"" he added. Rehman asserted that the state has authority over every agreement, and if this is not the case, those who made these agreements should be hanged in public.

Rehman said that the government has set the minimum wage at Rs37,000, but he challenged them to run a household with electricity bills and inflation at that rate. Questioning if the poor should choose the path of suicide, the JI chief stated that they had no choice but to engage in political resistance and called on the youth, lawyers, scholars, and civil society of Pakistan to join their movement. He said that their basic demands have been conveyed to the government’s negotiation committee, which include reducing electricity prices, ending the slab system, and abolishing taxes on salaried individuals. Pointing out that Pakistan collects four times more taxes than India, he highlighted that educated individuals, businessmen, and farmers are drowning in debt. There would be a public meeting today, and on Monday, women would come out in protest. He hinted at possibly announcing sit-ins across Pakistan in today's meeting, emphasizing that they will rise to claim their rights. He reiterated that both sit-ins and negotiations will continue simultaneously. Mere lip service, he warned, will not work, and Jamaat-e-Islami will not relent until public issues are resolved. It is noteworthy that Jamaat-e-Islami's sit-in at Liaquat Bagh in Rawalpindi has entered its third day, protesting against inflation and high electricity prices. Yesterday, JI formed a committee led by Liaqat Baloch for talks with the federal government. The government had requested Jamaat-e-Islami to immediately end the sit-in, a request which was declined by JI.

China approves use of local coal for three Pakistan power plants,"PK Move aims to cut costs and boost energy efficiency China has approved the conversion of three coal-fired power plants in Pakistan from imported coal to local coal, a significant move aimed at reducing energy costs. Sources confirmed that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Energy Minister Owais Leghari, currently visiting China, facilitated the agreement.  The plants affected include the 1,320 MW Sahiwal Coal Power Plant, the 1,320 MW Hub Power Plant, and the 1,320 MW Port Qasim Power Plant, all known for producing some of Pakistan's most expensive electricity. The Chinese delegation provided a positive response regarding the re-profiling of these coal power plants, ensuring a shift to local coal. The two countries also outlined the future steps required to advance this conversion process. Additionally, Chinese officials assured full support for Pakistan regarding Panda Bonds, further solidifying the cooperation between the two nations. Meetings between Pakistani and Chinese officials will continue to address the conversion and re-profiling of the power plants.

PPP signals talks with PTI if Imran Khan agrees ,"PK PPP leader Khurshid Shah sees dialogue as a positive step for stability Senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Khurshid Shah has stated that his party is prepared to facilitate dialogue if Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), is willing to engage. Speaking to the media in Quetta, Shah welcomed the possibility of talks as a positive development. ""It is being said that the PTI founder is ready to talk. If Imran Khan is ready to talk then that's a positive thing. ""President Asif Ali Zardari has always tried to solve problems through negotiations, and the PPP would play its role if needed,"" Shah said. The PPP's willingness to engage comes amidst a period of heightened political instability, following the PTI's hard-line stance against the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government. The PPP, along with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and other allies, supports the PML-N. Since Khan's ouster through a vote of no confidence in 2022, the PTI has maintained a strong opposition to the PPP-PML-N alliance.  Political tensions increased after the February 8 elections, which saw the two parties forming a coalition government in the Centre. Calls for reconciliation have been growing from various societal and political quarters, urging the PTI to negotiate with the government. The PTI had previously rejected talks with what it termed the ""Form-47 government,"" instead showing a preference for dialogue with the military establishment. In April, PTI's Shehryar Afridi indicated a preference for negotiations with the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) and the Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI). Subsequently, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub mentioned that Imran Khan had assigned significant responsibility to former President Dr Arif Alvi. Last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar confirmed that Khan had approved discussions with the government. Similarly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Khan's sister Aleema Khan called for state institutions to remain neutral for the country's progress. Federal Minister for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik also urged the PTI to come to the table for talks to resolve ongoing issues. Shah concluded by stating that it is a positive sign if Khan acknowledges the need for political dialogue, which is crucial for the country's stability and progress.
